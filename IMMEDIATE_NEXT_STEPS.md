## 🚀 Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Environment Setup (30 minutes)
```bash
cd /home/lio/github/greenhouse-monitoring/jetson-sam2-segmentation
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Creates Python virtual environment
- Installs PyTorch, OpenCV, and dependencies
- Downloads SAM2 repository and models
- Copies thermal data from Desktop
- Sets up project structure

### 2. Test Installation (10 minutes)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/test_installation.py
```

**Expected results:**
- All package imports successful
- ThermalImageProcessor working
- SAM2 availability confirmed
- Thermal data detected
- PyTorch device status

### 3. Analyze Thermal Data (20 minutes)
```bash
python scripts/analyze_thermal_data.py
```

**What you'll get:**
- Individual thermal image analysis
- Temperature range statistics
- Dataset summary visualization
- Video frame extraction
- Insights for segmentation strategy

## 📊 What to Expect from Analysis

### Thermal Image Characteristics
Based on your tCam-Mini setup, expect:
- **Resolution**: 160x120 pixels
- **Temperature Range**: Likely 15-35°C (room/plant temperatures)
- **Data Format**: PNG images with thermal encoding
- **Conversion**: Raw pixel values → temperature via radiometric formula

### Key Insights to Look For
1. **Temperature Contrast**: Difference between leaves and background
2. **Leaf Visibility**: How clearly leaves appear in thermal imagery
3. **Data Quality**: Consistency across images
4. **Segmentation Challenges**: Overlapping leaves, similar temperatures

## 🔬 Phase 1 Development Tasks (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Data Understanding
- [x] Run thermal data analysis
- [ ] Review temperature distributions
- [ ] Identify optimal images for SAM2 testing
- [ ] Document data characteristics

### Day 3-4: SAM2 Integration

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Daily Development Cycle
1. **Activate Environment**: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. **Run Tests**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality
3. **Develop**: Work on specific components
4. **Analyze**: Test on thermal data
5. **Document**: Update findings and next steps

### Key Files to Monitor
- `src/thermal_processor.py` - Core thermal processing
- `data/analysis_results/` - Analysis outputs
- `config.yaml` - Configuration parameters
- `JETSON_ORIN_SAM2_PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Master project plan

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Week 1

### Technical Milestones
- [ ] SAM2 successfully processes thermal images
- [ ] Temperature conversion accuracy validated
- [ ] Initial leaf segmentation achieved (even if imperfect)
- [ ] Processing pipeline established

### Understanding Milestones
- [ ] Thermal data characteristics documented
- [ ] Segmentation challenges identified
- [ ] Optimal preprocessing parameters determined
- [ ] Strategy for leaf identification defined

## 🚨 Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: SAM2 Model Download Fails
**Solution**: Manual download from Meta's repository
```bash
cd models/checkpoints
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/072824/sam2_hiera_large.pt
```

### Issue: GPU Not Available
**Solution**: CPU-only development (slower but functional)
- Update config.yaml: `device: "cpu"`
- Consider cloud GPU for testing

### Issue: Thermal Images Not Loading
**Solution**: Check image format and paths
- Verify images are in `/home/lio/Desktop/`
- Test with single image first
- Check file permissions

### Issue: Temperature Conversion Inaccurate
**Solution**: Calibrate conversion parameters
- Compare with known temperature references
- Adjust `kelvin_multiplier` and `kelvin_offset` in config
- Test with different thermal images

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Week 1 Checklist
- [ ] Environment setup complete
- [ ] Installation tests pass
